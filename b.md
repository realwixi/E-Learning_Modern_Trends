## verse 1
> The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”  They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity; there is none who does good.

- so called christians but living like a aetheist
- psalms 10:4-5
##  verse 2 & 3
> 2 God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
> 3 They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
- In new testament we found the righteous person that is Jesus. Matthew 3:17
    > and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased
 - Isaiah 53:2
	 > For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground;
- Isaiah 53:11
	> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;  
by his knowledge shall  the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities
- Now we see again the similarity of verse 2 & 3 in Romans 3:9-12
     >  What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, 10 as it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one; 11 no one understands; no one seeks for God. 12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”
